I like when people call my fixation or knowledge on things "charming". I know some people can take this as condescending but I think its for something you may not understand entirely, but you have an earnest appreciation of the persons devotion/dedication. Like it's used sarcastically so much it's almost taken away the beauty of the compliment. Take back charming, its a wonderful praise!
